        <h2>About Me</h2>
    </article>
    <p>My name is Nate Smith, and I am taking the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College in Ottawa. I am interested in video editing, motion graphics, and graphic design. I am from Kemptville, Ontario, where I went to <abbr title="North Grenville District High School">NGDHS</abbr>. I was in my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of high school when I started to get into media design. I am <em>very</em> happy with my experience at Algonquin so far.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I like to watch movies, play some video games, make videos, and spend time with family. I am interested in <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> football, Marvel, and DC. My favourite movie of all time is <em>The Dark Knight</em>. I would like to enter the film industry in some aspect, but I don't have a clear idea as to what role I would want to have.</p>
